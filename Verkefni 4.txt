1.
Unity is equally suited to creating both 2D and 3D games.
When you create a new project in Unity, you have the choice to start
in 2D or 3D mode. You may already know what you want to
build, but there are a few subtle points that may affect which mode you choose.
The choice between starting in2D or 3D mode determines some settings for the
Unity Editor, such as whether images are imported as textures or sprites
You can swap between 2D or 3D mode at any time regardless
of the mode you set when you created your project
that's super convenient 

2.
Single Screen where very common way back in the day
like during the Atari periond duo to there simle disng.
Single screen games are easily identified as each level or the
entire game takes place on a a single screen the camera / point of
view almost never changes a single screen game that everyone knows
is Pac-man the diffculty may increase with each level more enamys
can appare and the settings and landscape may change slightly

3.
2.5D means almost exclusively you are using 2D images(sprites)
to render your world even if it looks 3D its not examples of games
that have done this to grate sucsuess Clash of clans looks 3D but in
reality is a 2.5D game .The only differance really is the use of
the Z-Axis to slightly move up or down this is an extra game play aspect
that can be very good/useful to have when creating serten types of
games.
